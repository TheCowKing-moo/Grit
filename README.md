# Grit
A pack centered around automation and logistics

Pack Status: Pre-Alpha. Near ready for playtesting. All major mods have been selected, implemented, and configured for the world. many recipe changes have been made, but I will need to begin playtesting to really do more changes. 

Pack summary: Mods are locked behind ages. To advance to the next age you must provide a block called a research table a requested            upon amount of material. Once complted you advance, new mods are available, and the research table has new materials it wants you to get to the next age. rinse and repeat. 

Issues: I would like Electrical Age to one of the main pillars of the pack, but its not quite ready for 1.12. Luckily I am slow at this so itll probably be ready before I am. 

To-Do:
  1. Research Table materials needed calculation: Class and main function have been created but I am running into issues compiling it.
  2. Ages 3-7 Age balance changes. There will be many items that will be accidently locked behind the wrong age
  3. Age 7: Reasons to advance past it. 
  4. Advanced Rocketry: Delete or Keep. Adds cool stuff, but has a lot of issues, doesn't really conform to other mod configurations, and requires a LOT of work to get in a spot that I would like. The only real benefit I see is a cooler way to get to dimensions, which is something the pack is really lacking. Other than that its just another tech mod. 
  5. Quests: Ages 2-7
  6. Building Rewards: I would like to add a way for players to automatically have buildings made for them. Many players are not very good at building and the sheer amount of building required could be quite tedious. A way to just copy and paste could go a long way and be a really fun quest reward. ( Minecolonies, Schematica, RFTools, That starter house mod )
  7. Muli Area Tools: Pop them in the right ages
  8. Dank Null: Give each part an age
  9. RF early: Gen RF for tools early game
  10. Age 2 Autoamtion: Make sure that you can reasonablly autoamted all the requested materials in the age.
  11. Pipes: I like the age that LP pipes come in, but it feels odd to get all of AA, TE, and IE pipes in the age afterwards.
